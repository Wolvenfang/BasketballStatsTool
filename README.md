In the following project I took all the skills I've learned thus far in the curriculum and also researched new ones as 
well. A new skill I learned was, what and how to use a class. I enjoyed learning about "classes". I struggled quite a
bit in the creation of a function to display the teams as selectable options. Overall it was an excellent learning 
experience. Ready to tackle on the 3rd module of the curriculum.
